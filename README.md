# Cambridgeshire, UK street crime analysis (June 2017 - May 2018)

My investigation examines Cambridgeshire street crime and stop-and-search datasets provided by the [Home Office](https://data.police.uk/data/).
I use the datasets to search for patterns between the locations where the searches took place and the locations
where the crime was reported. In particular, I examine the drug related stop-and-search operations which resulted in an arrest.
